### 2023.03.30b1
- ➕ If a `ca.backup2` config file is detected, the plugin now offers a config migration
- 🔧 Changed the way "internal" volumes are detected: `/mnt/{user,cache}/appdata` and optionally the docker set folder are treated as such. Any other volume mapping (`/mnt/user/downloads/myDownloads` as example) is "external". You can optionally backup those too (disabled by default)
