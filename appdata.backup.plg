    <CHANGES>
        <![CDATA[
        ➕New  🩹Fix 🔧Change

###2024.02.26
- 🩹 Grouping input is now visible to dark theme users 😅
- 🔧 Container exclusion list is now being respected by the volume determination [Bug report](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/137710-plugin-appdatabackup/?do=findComment&comment=1376958)

- 🩹 Global exclusions are now also respected within extra files backup

###2024.02.06b
_That will be the last update for today! I promise! 🍻_

- 🩹 Add a permanent hidden `CSRF` form field to fix any `missing csrf_token` message

###2024.02.06a

- 🩹 Fixed logging appearance if grouped containers were involved

###2024.02.06 - 🚀 Happy new year!
- ➕ Container grouping
- ➕ Global exclusion list
- ➕ You can enable a notification for updated containers (disabled by default)
- ➕ If a plex container is detected, the plugin now offers some exclusions to start with
- ➕ New setting to skip container backup but include it into stop/start processes
- ➕ Click a volume mapping to add it to the exclusion list
- 🩹 `postBackup` script will now be executed after backup, before starting the container
- 🔧 Raise a warning (instead of info) if container has NO volumes to back up
- 🔧 Container updates are now handled directly after backing them up

###2023.10.16
- 🔧 The new success notification is now a setting and can be disabled (default).

###2023.09.27
- ➕ The plugin now creates a notice within Unraids notification system after a successful run.
- ➕ Show every error during cron checking
- 🔧 The plugin now calls every post/pre script with at least two arguments (type and current destination path) and a third one (backup result) for the postRun one.

###2023.09.12
- 🩹 The `Allowed sources` option was not filtered correctly, leading to an issue where all `External volumes` got backed up when they should not.
- 🩹 If extra file backup contains a symlink, it gets now resolved to its realpath.

###2023.08.28
- 🩹 Fix docker auto update always showing `no update available`

###2023.08.16
- 🩹 Booting the system could result in `rm: missing operand`.
- 🩹 `XML file for was not found` message - caused by deleted container - is fixed
- 🩹 Docker update would only update one container, if multiple containers using the same image.

###2023.08.15
- 🩹 Instead of no notifications, a new bug sent too much. Fixed! 😅
- 🔧 If a container stop-command fails, the plugin now tries again with `docker stop` variant.

###2023.08.14
- 🩹 Notifications were not sent, if notification level was set to `Errors only`
- ➕ `Download (debug) log` were replaced with a `Share log` dialog, which uploads the log to the developer (me)

###2023.06.23
- 🩹 PostBackup script was not executed (only if method was `Stop/Backup/Start`)
- 🩹 Restore non-compressed backups (containers as well as extra data) was not working

###2023.05.31
- 🩹 Settings: Not needed backup frequency fields are now disabled

###2023.05.19
- 🩹 Discard empty lines coming from the `allowed sources` option text-fields. Led to unexpected behavior

###2023.05.09
- ➕ A click on a container volume path, adds it to the container exclusion list

###2023.04.27
- 🔧 Skip non-existent host volume path mapping
- 🩹 De-duplicate final volume mappings. [Bug report](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/137710-plugin-appdatabackup/?do=findComment&comment=1256267)

###2023.04.26
- 🩹 Another small fix for rare nested volume detection issue
- 🩹 Fix cronjob again: Scheduling got lost after reboot - now using the right way for cron update
- 🩹 Fix nested volume check
- 🩹 Apply nested volume check only with paths within appdata (allowed sources)
- 🩹 Fix applying default settings to per-container settings for new config options. [Bug report](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/137710-plugin-appdatabackup/?do=findComment&comment=1252597)
- 🩹 Remove container volume mapping, if it is listed in allowed sources
- 🩹 Scheduling no longer sends mails like "cron for user root ....."
- 🔧 Ignore volumes which match against exact exclusion path within container settings
- 🔧 Ignore nested volume (`/mnt/user/appdata/test`, `/mnt/user/appdata/text/config` => The latter would be ignored now)

###2023.04.15a
- 🩹 Fix CSS bottom border for dark themes
- 🩹 Optimize volume detection for useless mappings (from our point of view)

###2023.04.15
- 🩹 Fix colors on dark themes inside per-container-settings section
- 🔧 Add a warning to the log, if "external volume backup" is enabled for a container

###2023.04.11
- 🩹 Saving the settings with no docker containers yet, results in a blank page

###2023.04.10
- 🚀 First stable version!

###2023.04.03b1
- 🩹 Fixed file selector for dark themes _(Unraids global config variable handling needs a revamp...)_

### 2023.03.31b2
- 🩹 ca.backup2 migration: Migrate old source path as well

### 2023.03.31b1
- ➕ The restore default source path defaults now to the current set destination path
- 🔧 You can choose a custom restore path now. This could be useful for advanced restoring. **This only applies to extracted archives, not for the config/xmls!**
- 🔧 Changed the internal/external volume mapping detection again: You can choose ALL of your valid appdata sources now. **Open help for `Appdata source(s)` for further explanation**

### 2023.03.30b1
- ➕ If a `ca.backup2` config file is detected, the plugin now offers a config migration
- 🔧 Changed the way "internal" volumes are detected: `/mnt/{user,cache}/appdata` and optionally the docker set folder are treated as such. Any other volume mapping (`/mnt/user/downloads/myDownloads` as example) is "external". You can optionally backup those too (disabled by default)

### 2023.03.29b2
- 🩹 "External" volumes (volumes not within your appdata) path are now being ignored. A future update will bring options to save them as well
- 🩹 Container exclude list was not working as expected
- 🩹 Fixed settings page issues for Safari users
- 🩹 Fixed an issue during applying default settings to containers
- 🔧 Faild backups are now kept (with -failed suffix)
- 🔧 `Abort` now instantly stops any running command instead of waiting for its completion

### 2023.03.28b3
- 🩹 Some file selectors are opening some others - fixed
- 🔧 Display container volumes one per line

### 2023.03.28b2
- 🩹 Fixed per container (only new ones) settings being hard-set to the global defaults instead of keeping 'Use default'
- ➕ Added back update notice banner

### 2023.03.28b1
- ➕ Added back VM meta backup
- ➕ Added back update notice banner

### 2023.03.27b1
- ➕ 1st beta
